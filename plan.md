I'm building a research analysis tool for Fantasy Football.

I'm ingesting data from espn apis, storing that data in a sqlite database, and then building data visualizations and analysis from that data.

My priority is a working proof of concept, this does not need to scalable, just that it works and is well-tested.

I need you to:
- ingest data from the endpoints that are currently written in main.py and the teams.json data
- create a schema for the data 
- store the data in a sqlite database
- demonstrate querying for that data in a sqlite database
- perform a basic analysis on the data

Use the pythonengineer subagent to perform this work.
